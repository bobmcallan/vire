1. Kneppy Invests: The "Quality" Technical MeasuresBased on his analysis of high-quality ASX stocks (like Objective Corp, CSL, and small-caps), his core technical filters often include:The 200-Day Moving Average (MA): A primary "buy/sell" filter. High-quality stocks should ideally be trading above their 200-day MA. A break above this line often signals a transition from "speculative" to "quality momentum."Operating Cash Flow (Appendix 4C/5B): For small caps, he looks for positive operating cash flow or a clear trajectory toward it. If a company is burning cash without a 4C improvement, it fails the "quality" test regardless of the product.Margin Expansion: He prioritizes companies where profit margins are increasing alongside revenue. If revenue grows by 30% but margins shrink, it suggests a lack of "operating leverage."200-Week MA for Blue Chips: For larger ASX stocks (CBA, WES), he uses the 200-week MA to identify "generational" buying zones for quality companies that are temporarily out of favor.2. Quantitative Quality BenchmarksStandard analyst measures for "Quality" (often used by firms like MSCI or VanEck for their Quality ETFs) provide a numerical checklist for your analysis:CategoryMetric"High Quality" BenchmarkEfficiencyReturn on Equity (ROE)> 15% (Sustained over 5 years)ProfitabilityGross Margin> 30% - 40% (Indicates pricing power)Cash StrengthFCF Conversion> 80% of Net Income converted to Free Cash FlowSolvencyNet Debt to EBITDA< 2.0x (Ensures the company isn't over-leveraged)ConsistencyEarnings VariabilityLow deviation in EPS growth over a 5-year period3. The "Moat" & Management AssessmentBeyond the numbers, analysts look for these qualitative "technical" structural advantages:Switching Costs: High for software companies (e.g., your interest in Enterprise/SaaS models).Intangible Assets: Patents, regulatory licenses, or brand power that allow for premium pricing.Incentive Alignment: Reviewing proxy statements to see if management's bonuses are tied to ROE or FCF targets rather than just "Total Shareholder Return."4. Red Flags: The "Anti-Quality" ListIf a company hits these markers, it is generally downgraded from "Quality" to "Speculative":High Accruals: If net income is significantly higher than cash flow (suggests aggressive accounting).Constant Share Issuance: Frequent capital raises that dilute shareholders to fund operations.Flat-lining Revenue: Even with high margins, a company that cannot grow revenue is a "value trap," not a "quality growth" play.
