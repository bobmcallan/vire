# Services

## MarketService

Interface in `internal/interfaces/services.go`. Collection methods in `internal/services/market/collect.go`.

### Composite Methods

| Method | Scope | Used By |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `CollectMarketData` | Full: EOD + fundamentals + filings + news + AI | Job manager, manual |
| `CollectCoreMarketData` | Fast: EOD (bulk) + fundamentals only | GenerateReport, GenerateTickerReport |

### Individual Methods

| Method | Data | Used By |
|--------|------|---------|
| `CollectEOD` | EOD bars (incremental) + signals | Job manager (fallback) |
| `CollectBulkEOD` | Last-day EOD for all tickers on exchange | Job manager (collect_eod_bulk) |
| `CollectFundamentals` | Company fundamentals | Job manager |
| `CollectFilings` | ASX announcements | Job manager |
| `CollectNews` | News articles | Job manager |
| `CollectFilingSummaries` | AI filing summaries (Gemini) | Job manager |
| `CollectTimeline` | Structured company timeline | Job manager |
| `CollectNewsIntelligence` | AI news sentiment (Gemini) | Job manager |
| `ReadFiling` | Extract text from filing PDF | MCP tool |

### GetStockData

Serves filing summaries, timeline, quality assessment from cached MarketData. No Gemini calls. Quality assessment computed on demand if fundamentals exist. `force_refresh=true` triggers inline CollectCoreMarketData + background EnqueueSlowDataJobs, response includes advisory.

Handler applies a 90s context timeout before calling GetStockData and CollectCoreMarketData. GetStockData applies a 60s timeout on the CollectMarketData fallback (triggered when market data is missing from storage). These bounds account for multiple EODHD requests at 30s each.

### Filing Summaries

- Prompt versioning via SHA-256 hash (`FilingSummaryPromptHash`). Changed prompt triggers regeneration.
- Memory management: nil unused fields during processing, batch size 2, intermediate saves, runtime.GC() between batches.
- `FilingSummary` includes `financial_summary` and `performance_commentary`.

### QualityAssessment

Computed from fundamentals. 7 scored metrics (ROE, GrossMargin, FCFConversion, NetDebtToEBITDA, EarningsStability, RevenueGrowth, MarginTrend). Overall ratings: "High Quality" / "Quality" / "Average" / "Below Average" / "Speculative".

## Portfolio Service

`internal/services/portfolio/`

### External Balances (`external_balances.go`)

Cash accounts, term deposits, accumulate, offset accounts. Stored on Portfolio model. `recomputeExternalBalanceTotal` sums values; `recomputeHoldingWeights` uses `totalMarketValue + ExternalBalanceTotal` as denominator.

SyncPortfolio preserves external balances across re-syncs via raw UserDataStore.Get.

### Indicators (`indicators.go`)

Portfolio treated as single instrument. Computes EMA/RSI/SMA/trend on daily value time series. `growthToBars` converts GrowthDataPoint to EODBar adding external balance total.

### Price Refresh

Prefers AdjClose over Close via `eodClosePrice()`. Divergence sanity check (50% threshold). Falls back to Close if AdjClose is zero, negative, Inf, NaN.

### Watchlist Review

Same signal/compliance pipeline as ReviewPortfolio but for watchlist tickers. No FX conversion or position weights. Passes nil holding to action/compliance checks.

## Signal Service

`internal/services/signal/service.go`

Overlays real-time quotes onto cached EOD bars before computing indicators. `overlayLiveQuote()` updates today's bar or prepends synthetic bar. Non-fatal: nil client or failed fetch uses cached data.

## Report Service

`internal/services/report/`

`GenerateReport`: Navexa sync → CollectCoreMarketData (fast path) → portfolio review → format → store to BadgerDB. `GenerateTickerReport`: single-ticker CollectCoreMarketData.

Report markdown wraps EODHD data under `## EODHD Market Analysis`. Non-EODHD sections at `##` level.

## Cash Flow Service

`internal/services/cashflow/service.go`

Uses UserDataStore subject "cashflow", key = portfolio name. Transactions sorted by date ascending. `CalculatePerformance` computes XIRR (Newton-Raphson with bisection fallback). Terminal value = TotalValueHoldings + ExternalBalanceTotal.

Transaction types: deposit, withdrawal, contribution, transfer_in, transfer_out, dividend. Inflows: deposit, contribution, transfer_in, dividend.

Capital performance embedded in `get_portfolio` response (non-fatal errors swallowed).
