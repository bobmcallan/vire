I'm comfortable with the accuracy of the vire technical data, I'm more concerned about the company reporting, specifically financial numbers over past 2 - 3 years, the summary of any price sensitive information, and business forecasts - extracted from the company release and the review of how realistic the forecasts is. i.e. I'm looking for a 'real' assessment on the qquality of the company, it's business model and does it match the strategy rules now and going forward.

5-year revenue CAGR from $25M (2019) to $340M (FY26 guided) is extraordinary — roughly 68% CAGR.
What Vire reported: "Revenue increased FY2025, trend up" and "10% annual growth assessment: Yes." This is technically correct but massively understates the story. Vire's filing intelligence captured the Delta Elcom acquisition and data centre contracts but didn't surface the actual revenue/profit numbers from FY23-FY25 or the specific guidance figures ($340M rev, $34M PBT, 10% margin). The narrative summary is directionally right but lacks the quantitative backbone you'd need for a strategy compliance check.
Vire accuracy grade for company reporting: 6/10 — gets the direction and catalysts right, misses the hard numbers.
2. Price-Sensitive Information Summary
From external sources, the key announcements are:

Nov 2025: $130M data centre project secured + Delta Elcom acquisition announced ($13.75-15M for ~$25M revenue business)
Dec 2025: Delta Elcom sale agreement executed
Jan 12, 2026: Delta Elcom acquisition completed. 612,501 new shares issued ($2M worth). Cash portion $10.5M funded from reserves (cash balance was $42.5M at Oct 2025)
Feb 5, 2026: $60M new contracts (NEXTDC M3 Stage 4 + EY Melbourne fit-out). Revenue guidance lifted from $320M → $340M. PBT guidance lifted from $28.8M → $34M. Margin improvement 9% → 10%. Work on hand at record $325M.
Feb 24, 2026: H1 FY26 results due (10 days away)

What Vire reported: All 10 announcements in the filings list are accurate and correctly dated. The headlines match. Vire correctly flagged the Feb 5 contract award and FY26 profit upgrade as "HIGH" relevance. However, Vire didn't extract the specific financial details from the announcements — the $340M revenue figure, the $34M PBT, the $325M work on hand, the 10% margin, or the acquisition price of Delta Elcom.
Vire accuracy grade for price-sensitive info: 7/10 — correct identification and dating of announcements, but needs to extract the actual numbers from within announcements to be genuinely useful for decision-making.
3. Business Model & Forecast Realism
The business model: SKS is an electrical/AV/comms contractor that has pivoted heavily into data centre construction. They design, supply, and install integrated electrical infrastructure. Revenue is project-based (not recurring), which means lumpy but with strong forward visibility when backlog is high.
Why the forecasts look credible:

$325M work on hand against $340M FY26 revenue guidance means ~96% is already contracted. That's very high visibility.
The upgrade came only 3 months after the Nov 2025 guidance of $320M/$28.8M — management is being conservative and upgrading as contracts land
94% repeat business rate in FY25 — clients come back
Data centre construction is a structural tailwind (AI, cloud) with years of runway
Delta Elcom gives them NSW presence (Australia's largest DC market) with immediate $25M revenue contribution
CEO Matthew Jinks has been consistently under-promising and over-delivering across FY23-FY26

Risks to the forecast:

Project-based revenue = execution risk. One delayed project could swing a quarter
Data centre concentration is increasing — sector downturn would hit hard
P/E at 35x (on trailing) is pricing in continued high growth. Any stumble and it corrects sharply
Integration risk with Delta Elcom (different geography, team blending)
Labour market for electrical contractors is tight in Australia
The stock has run from $1.39 to $4.08 in 12 months — a lot of good news is priced in

4. Strategy Compliance Assessment
Checking against your SMSF strategy core selection criteria (all 7 must be met):

Your $20k position is fine✅6RSI <70, at support or accumulationRSI 58, neutral — currently compliant✅7Beta ≤1.30.34✅
All 7 core selection criteria pass. This is one of the better strategy fits in your portfolio.
However — the company filter flags:

P/E of 35.25 exceeds your max 25.0 threshold. This is the key tension. The P/E is elevated because the market is pricing in the FY26 earnings ramp. If you use forward P/E on the $34M PBT guidance against ~113M shares, you get roughly $0.30 EPS → forward P/E of ~13.6. That's well inside your threshold. The question is whether you measure trailing or forward.
Analyst consensus is a Hold at $4.00 target — you're already at $4.08

5. Bottom Line Assessment
SKS is a genuine revenue-backed compounder that fits your strategy criteria on 7/7 core rules. The management team has a track record of under-promising and over-delivering across 4 consecutive years of revenue growth. The data centre tailwind is structural and multi-year. The Delta Elcom acquisition was sensibly priced at 5x earnings with clear strategic rationale.
The concern is valuation. At trailing P/E 35x, any execution miss will be punished hard. The forward P/E of ~13.6x on guided earnings is attractive, but that guidance needs to land. H1 FY26 results on Feb 24 will be the next test — if they confirm the trajectory, this position looks well-placed. If they disappoint, the high trailing multiple means limited downside support.
For Vire improvement: The filing intelligence needs to extract actual financial numbers from announcements rather than just identifying them as "HIGH" relevance. Revenue guidance, profit guidance, margin %, work on hand, and acquisition terms should all surface in the stock data output. The qualitative narrative is solid; it's the quantitative detail that's missing.
